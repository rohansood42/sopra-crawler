      "Does your Information System (IS) allow you to offer high-quality customer service?  Or is the data indispensable to informed decision-making and sound knowledge of your customers fragmented divided across different systems that do not communicate with one another?  Sopra Steria can help you control your data. Our experts, specialising in multiple technologies and standards, are well aware that our clients' pre-existing systems hold highly valuable sets of data. We believe that by integrating information from multiple sources to present them clearly in a single operational view, companies are at last able to access information. This will guide their strategic decisions and improve the overall effectiveness of their organisation to the benefit of their business-line transformation projects.  Our extensive experience of integration projects, both software-package solutions and specific business-line applications, has taught us that successful integration does not stop at the interconnection of networked systems. Real-time management of information flows involves establishing connections, interfaces and complex security checks.    As specialists in systems integration, we are involved from the consultancy stage through to designing and deploying solutions. Once integrated, technology can become a substantial source of income, giving you access to invaluable data on your customers' behaviour and allowing you to make operating efficiency gains.  \n",
